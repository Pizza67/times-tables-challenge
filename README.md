## Rounds 
A player must try to answer up to 20 times tables questions in 30 seconds.

Based on the final score the player can reach one of the following levels:

* **Student**: if the final score is up to 6
* **Expert**: if the score is between 7 and 12
* **Champion**: if the score is between 13 and 17
* **Superhero**: if the score is between 18 and 19
* **Cosmic Legend**: if the score is 20

The resulting score of each round is used to track progress and measure the improvements.

## Achievements
In the journey the player may unlock the following achievements which are awarded based on a player's average score across all completed rounds.

* **Novice Learner**: average score is below 8, or you have played fewer than 20 rounds
* **Rising Genius**: average score is below 12 and you have played fewer than 40 rounds
* **Sparkling Champion**: average score is below 15 and you have played fewer than 80 rounds
* **Supereme Hero**: average score is below 18 and you have played fewer than 100 rounds
* **Galactic Master**: average score of 18 or higher and you have played at least 100 rounds

_Pro Tip:_ To boost your average score, try replaying your lowest-scoring rounds to improve those results.

## Challenge Mode
Generate a unique round ID and share it with your opponents via QR code or a custom URL. 
Each player can start the round whenever they're ready, but everyone faces the same challenging questions.

_Remember, your performance in Challenge Mode rounds counts towards your overall average score!_

The app works completely offline and no user account is required to play.
