## Rounds 
A player must try to answer up to 20 times tables questions in 30 seconds.

Based on the final score the player can reach one of the following levels:

* **Student**: Score is up to 6
* **Expert**: Score is between 7 and 12
* **Champion**: Score is between 13 and 17
* **Superhero**: Score is between 18 and 19
* **Cosmic Legend**: Score is 20

The resulting score of each round is used to track progress and measure the improvements.

## Achievements
In the journey the player may unlock the following achievements which are awarded based on a player's average score across all completed rounds.

* **Novice Learner**: Average score is below 8, or you have played fewer than 20 rounds
* **Rising Genius**: Average score is below 12 and you have played fewer than 40 rounds
* **Sparkling Champion**: Average score is below 15 and you have played fewer than 80 rounds
* **Supereme Hero**: Average score is below 18 and you have played fewer than 100 rounds
* **Galactic Master**: Average score of 18 or higher and you have played at least 100 rounds

_Pro Tip:_ To boost your average score, try replaying your lowest-scoring rounds to improve those results.

## Challenge Mode
Generate a unique round ID and share it with your opponents via QR code or a custom URL. 
Each player can start the round whenever they're ready, but everyone faces the same challenging questions.

_Remember, your performance in Challenge Mode rounds counts towards your overall average score!_

## Game variants
Game rules can be changed a bit without changing the way levels and achievements are reached.

* **Go Beyond 9**: Extend the times tables up to 12 for an extra challenge. (Default: Times tables up to 9)
* **Self-Sabotage**: With this option enabled, your score for each round is permanently recorded, even if you replay it and get a lower score. (Default: Only your highest score for each round is saved)
* **Track time left**: In this mode, your best round score will factor in the time you have remaining after answering all questions. The faster you are, the higher your potential score! (Default: Time remaining does not affect the score)

The app works completely offline and no user account is required to play.
